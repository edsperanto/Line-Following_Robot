# Line-Following_Robot

## Summary

This line-following robot was created for ECEGR 3121 Junior Lab II class. Our professor set up a winding course that we had to build a small, wheeled robot to run through. The robot was limited to use only a reflectance sensor array to sense its environment, which proved extremely unreliable. We had to program logic for the robot to finish the course twice (forwards, turn around, and backwards) despite this limitation.

Note that this is not the final version of the code that was used to run the robot in the course, but an earlier version with the basic functionality. I did not archive the final code and could no longer find it :/

## How to run

1. Install [wiringPi](http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/) on your Raspberry Pi
2. Download the GitHub repository
3. Compile by running `bash compile.sh`
4. Run the program with `./go_robot`
